## Usage Examples

### Basic Text Analysis
```python
# Enter this text in the app:
"Selamat pagi semua! Hari ini cuaca cerah."

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Models not loading**
   - Ensure model files exist in the `models/` directory
   - Check file permissions and paths

2. **Abusive words dictionary not found**
   - Verify `IndonesianAbusiveWords/abusive.csv` exists
   - Check CSV format (should have 'ABUSIVE' column)

3. **Import errors**
   - Install all required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Check Python path configuration

### Performance Tips

- For best results, use Indonesian text
- Keep text length reasonable (< 10,000 characters)
- Use the sidebar options to customize analysis features
